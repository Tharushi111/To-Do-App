# 📝 My To-Do App

A simple, clean, and user-friendly To-Do web application built with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It uses **SweetAlert2** for modern and elegant modals to add, edit, and delete tasks and subtasks.  
The app stores your tasks locally using **localStorage**, so your data persists in your browser.
